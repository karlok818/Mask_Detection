# Mask_Detection

Image classification, which is a big part of machine learning, is a process in computer vision which classifies images based on their visual content and predefined categories (Naufal et al., 2021). Deep learning is very often used in the case of face mask detection due to its high level of accuracy. Several studies have shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); for instance, VGG-16, Resnet, MobileNet, are efficient in face mask detection (Goyal et al., 2022). However, these models often require large memory and computational time. The challenge of the face mask detection system is not only about achieving high accuracy, but also having computational efficiency so that it can be implemented easily and inexpensively with minimum resource requirement in various public places. Therefore, more research into accurate and computationally efficient face mask identification algorithms is required.

This project proposes multiple classification machine learning models to identify and classify the different ways to wear a face mask. These models are Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

This project was done by me and my teammates (Tay Shi Hui, Wong Hui Yeok and Jonathan).
